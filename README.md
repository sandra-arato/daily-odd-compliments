daily-odd-compliments
=====================

mini project to show odd compliments on a web page based on the Facebook postings of the tumblr page “Daily Odd Compliments”


Main task: build a website that shows one compliment for 4-5 secs then changes it to a different one.

On load, the website loads X number of quotes from the Facebook page, (maybe last 30 days) and selects the right compliments from the request.
Each compliment must be less than 160 characters.
The compliments then are stored in an array, and divs are built around them and arranged on the website.
The colour of the divs is random, as well as the order of the compliments.
The divs change with a clipping method, used previously at Condo Kings Project.
Extra buttons on the top help sharing: copy to clipboard, share on FB, tweet it.
Has to be responsive and working in IE8+, Chrome and Firefox.
